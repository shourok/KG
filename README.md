# Knowledge-Graph Enhanced VNE for 6G Datacenters
This repository contains the reproducible implementation of a
knowledge-graph–driven virtual network embedding framework for 6G
cloud datacenters using Neo4j, Mininet, and ONOS.

Pipeline:
1) Substrate ingestion into Neo4j
2) Hidden relation inference
3) KG-assisted VNE decision
4) SDN enforcement via ONOS

This code supports experimental evaluation of scalability,
resource utilization, and reasoning-aware embedding.
